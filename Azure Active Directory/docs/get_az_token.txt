What a Successful Token Response Implies

If you get a token back:

The app does not require MFA (since ROPC cannot satisfy MFA).

The user is allowed to authenticate with just username and password.

The app is not blocked by Conditional Access or federation restrictions.
 

In other words, if anything other than 400 (Bad Request) is returned it may indicate a problem.

To make it easier to spot I made the output of a successful token obtainment in RED.

Under https://intune.microsoft.com/ under Sign-in logs you can see the errors when MFA is expected but not used:

Sign-in error code 50076 in Azure AD indicates that MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) is required.
